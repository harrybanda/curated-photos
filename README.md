## Curated Photos

A React app that allows viewing and interacting with a grid of curated photos from Unsplash.

## Project Status

All the challange tasks work as expected on Google Chrome browser, due to time I was not able to:

1. Test it on all browsers e.g Safari, Firefox
2. Add unit tests using the react-testing-library
3. Authenticaion flow
